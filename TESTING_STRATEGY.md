# Testing Strategy Document

## 1. Testing Frameworks
- **Framework**: `unittest`
  - **Justification**: This is a built-in Python framework that is simple to use and well-suited for the project's needs. It supports test discovery and offers a range of assertions that can be utilized to validate the function's behavior.

## 2. Directory Structure
- **Recommended Structure**:
  ```
  ├── tests/
  │   ├── __init__.py  # marks the directory as a package
  │   ├── test_multiply.py  # contains tests for multiply function
  │   ├── test_performance.py  # contains performance tests
  │   └── test_edge_cases.py  # contains edge case tests
  └── multiply.py
  ```

## 3. Testing Standards
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - Test file names should be prefixed with 'test_' to ensure they are easily identifiable as test files (e.g., `test_multiply.py`).
  - Test case classes should be named in PascalCase suffixed with "Test" (e.g., `TestMultiplyFunction`).
  - Individual test methods should be prefixed with "test_" and describe the functionality being tested (e.g., `test_multiply_by_zero`).

## 4. Prioritized Components
- **Initial Testing Focus**:
  1. **Basic Multiplication Cases**: Ensure standard functionality.
  2. **Edge Cases**: Test with zero, negative values, and large numbers.
  3. **Invalid Input Handling**: Check response to non-numeric input and other invalid cases.
  4. **Performance Tests**: Assess performance with large values or inputs.

## 5. Mocking Strategy
- **External Dependencies**: As of now, it seems that there are no external dependencies to mock. If future features are added that rely on external services or files, the following should be considered:
  - Use Mock objects from the `unittest.mock` module to simulate external dependency behaviors.

## 6. Configuration
- Ensure Python and `unittest` are installed in the environment.
- Basic command to execute tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Future Considerations
- Enhance coverage to include floating-point precision tests and consider adding integration tests if the functionality expands in the future.
