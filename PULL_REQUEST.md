# Pull Request: Add Unit Tests for Multiply Function

## Purpose
This pull request introduces a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the `multiply_numbers` function. The addition of these tests aims to enhance the reliability and stability of the application by ensuring that the multiplication function behaves as expected across a range of scenarios.

## Coverage
The unit tests cover:
- Multiplication of positive integers
- Multiplication of negative integers
- Multiplication involving zero
- Multiplication with floating-point numbers

## Implementation
The tests utilize the `unittest` framework, a core Python library, providing tools for test construction and execution. Every test method seeks specific inputs and verifies that outcomes align with expectations.

## Setup
To run these tests:
1. Make sure all necessary dependencies are installed.
2. Execute the tests with:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```
3. Check the test results for any failures requiring attention.

## Future Work
- Extend tests for additional edge cases, particularly involving large integers.
- Consider integrating tests with other components in the application that utilize the multiplication function.
