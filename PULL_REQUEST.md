# Pull Request: Unit Tests for multiply_numbers Function

## Purpose
This pull request adds comprehensive unit tests for the `multiply_numbers` function, ensuring its functionality across various scenarios.

## Coverage
The tests cover:
- Multiplying two positive numbers
- Multiplying two negative numbers
- Multiplying a number by zero
- Multiplying two floating-point numbers

## Implementation
The tests are implemented using the `unittest` framework and include tests for different edge cases and normal cases.

## Setup
To run the tests, ensure you have Python and the `unittest` framework installed. You can execute the tests using the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_multiply.py
```

## Future Work
Future enhancements may include:
- More edge case tests, including integer overflow scenarios.
- Testing for invalid inputs (e.g., strings, None type).
