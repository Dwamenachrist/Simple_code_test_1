# Pull Request: Add Unit Tests for Multiply Function

## Purpose
This pull request introduces a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the `multiply_numbers` function. The addition of these tests aims to enhance the reliability and stability of the application by ensuring that the multiplication function behaves as expected across a range of scenarios.

## Coverage
The unit tests cover the following components:
- Multiplication of positive integers
- Multiplication of negative integers
- Multiplication involving zero
- Multiplication with floating-point numbers

## Implementation
The tests use the `unittest` framework, a built-in module in Python that provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. Each test case checks specific inputs and verifies that the output matches the expected results.

## Setup
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the tests using the command:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```
3. Review the output for any failed tests that require attention.

## Future Work
- Implement additional tests for edge cases not currently covered, such as very large integers.
- Consider integration tests that validate the behavior of the multiplication function when used within larger components of the application.
